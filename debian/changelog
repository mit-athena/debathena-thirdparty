  [ Jonathan Reed ]
  * Use chdist to generate the list of packages on Ubuntu, so as to
    include multiverse.
  * Build-Depend on lsb-release (for lsb_release) and devscripts (for chdist)
  * Syntax errors in the common package list are now fatal
  * This package is now an arch-dependent package, since the final package
    list will differ across architectures (I'm look at you, mit-scheme)
